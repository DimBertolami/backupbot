# Cryptobot
building  a real-time cryptocurrency trading bot 


1) Gather live and historical data.
2) Prepare data for analysis (e.g., scaling, splitting).
3) Create additional features like moving averages or price clusters.
**4) Train machine learning models using historical data.**
5) Use trained models to predict trends and decide actions.
6) Execute trades using APIs like Alpaca.

I'm at step 4. but i already have the python code that can train the different models using the historical data and use this trained model to predict trends and make a buy/hold/sell decision.
So: I just need to write (or find) the code that executes the trade and then I focus on the website part (front-end and back-end)
